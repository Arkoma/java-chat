# java-chat
This is a copy of the spark-websocket chat application from https://github.com/tipsy/spark-websocket

I have copied it for practice using java and IntelliJ IDE

To see what this app does, clone it, complie it, and open localhost:4567 in separate browser windows and let your "buds" chat with each other.
